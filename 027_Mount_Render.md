### 027 React - Mount
[Reference: Mount](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31556450/what-is-mounting-in-react-js)
> The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen.

> React does so by "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).
