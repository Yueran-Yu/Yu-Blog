## Thinking About Data Flow

- Did you notice what yi did in the last video? He is doing something that a lot of senior developers do, and that is they think about their data flow. They don't just go ahead and start coding.
- If it works the first time that;s great, they are done.
- No, in their head or maybe on a piece of paper or in a diagram they're thinking about how data is moving. For example, in our case from our redux store into our components. Yi is deciding how much of that data do I want by using selectors and then deciding where should that data live. Where should I put that data.
- No one rule while you want to do is to think about your application and why you think at the moment the client or yourself wants for the project.
- They keep things extensible. But at the same time, they decide what makes sense what components component should be in charge of what should be a connected component to a redux store or should it be a simple presentational component that just renders something simple.
