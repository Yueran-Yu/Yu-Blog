1. Research the topic you want to learn
    - About how it works.
    - Goal: By the time you've done with the research you can explain what this concept or technology or language or framework is to someone in a way that would make them understand it.
    - That means: you actually have a fairly deep understanding of what the dea is even if you don't know how to use this idea.
    - At the end of it, you should pretty solid understanding of the pros and cons of using this certain language or topic or framework.
    - You should know any libraries or frameworks that are popular and helpful in using this actual language
> For example, for ```node.js```, a very popular framework is ```Express``` so you should know about the existence of this framework so you can possible learn it later in your learning experience for learning ```node.js```
2. Learn how you can use this sort of topic and how it works
    - Read the documentation, but you don't need to go into the nitty-gritty
    - Start from the ```Getting Start``` or ```Introduction``` section in their documentation that you should familiarize yourself with so that you can read through it and have a basic understanding of **how you would set up a project** of this magnitude.
    - You need to follow the instruction of installing anything you need to use for starting a project.
    - Start a ```Hello Word```-like smallest size application that help you learn little by little of that skill.
    - The next step, dependent on what you're learning but then is to create another small application and possible event the exact similar application but to use some popular frameworks or libraries inside of that application. After you comparing two versions of different technologies you use, you will see where it's easier and where it's harder with using that framework.

  > For example, for ```node.js``` application, you need to create a ```sever``` and print out something to the screen.
  >>
  > When you ```running into problems```, you can google tutorials or instructional videos or anything like that. Just to Figure out how to ```get past these roadblocks``` that you encountered in your learning process.
  >>
  > The most important thing you will get here is you will have basic understanding of how to get something working and then that way you can add on to it without having extra problems.
